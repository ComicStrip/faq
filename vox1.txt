Here’s the same information in plain text format:

Lady Vox’s problem is almost certainly caused by her computer refusing to connect to “http://umbrel.local” because it only allows HTTPS.

Explanation:
Umbrel’s local dashboard (umbrel.local) only uses HTTP by default. It is not a public website; it runs on your local network.
Modern browsers like Chrome and Edge often force HTTPS connections to any address they’ve seen before, including “.local”.
When that happens, the browser tries to go to “https://umbrel.local”, but Umbrel doesn’t have an HTTPS certificate for local use.
That causes connection errors or “Not secure” warnings — which is exactly what she’s describing.

⸻

Fix Options:

Option 1: Force HTTP manually
Type this exactly in the browser’s address bar:
http://umbrel.local
Press Enter.
Make sure there is no “s” in “http”.
If it automatically changes to “https://”, continue with Option 2.

⸻

Option 2: Clear HSTS cache (for Chrome or Edge)
	1.	In the browser address bar, type: chrome://net-internals/#hsts
	2.	Under “Delete domain security policies,” type: umbrel.local
	3.	Click “Delete.”
	4.	Then go back and open: http://umbrel.local

⸻

Option 3: Access Umbrel by its local IP address
If the above does not work, find Umbrel’s local IP address:
	•	Check your router’s connected devices list for something named “umbrel”
	•	Or use a phone app like “Fing” to scan your network

Once you have the IP address, type it into your browser like this:
http://192.168.1.42   (replace this number with the real address)

⸻

Option 4: Use Tor browser (optional)
If Tor access is enabled in Umbrel, you can connect through the .onion address using Tor Browser.
That uses HTTPS automatically and avoids local network issues.

⸻

Summary:
Problem: Browser forces HTTPS, Umbrel only serves HTTP locally.
Fix: Access using http://umbrel.local or http://.
If the browser keeps switching to HTTPS, clear the HSTS cache.
Tor browser is an optional secure alternative.

Would you like me to include simple step-by-step instructions for finding the Umbrel IP address on Windows or macOS?
